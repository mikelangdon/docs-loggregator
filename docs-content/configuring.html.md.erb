<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The Loggregator system now uses <a href="http://www.grpc.io/">gRPC</a> for communication between the Metron Agent and the Doppler, and between the Doppler and the Traffic Controller. This improves the stability and the performance of the Loggregator system, but it may require operators to scale their Dopplers.</p>
