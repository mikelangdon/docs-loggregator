deployment and ensure it is in a good operational state.

                Can also give you a sense of how many AIs have been started over time.
                Suggested alert threshold can help indicate a lot of container churn.

                <strong>Use</strong>: Failing task auctions indicate a lack of resources 
                        within your environment and that you likely need to scale. 
                        This indicator can also increase when the task is requesting an isolation segment, volume drivers,

          <strong>Use</strong>: If the convergence run begins taking too long, 
          it is possible that apps or tasks are crashing and not being restarted.

      <td>Remaining amount in MiB of memory available for this cell to allocate to containers. Emitted every 30 seconds.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Use</strong>: Indicates the available cell memory. 
          If low memory, this could prevent app scaling and new deployments. 
          It is common to look at this metric as both a minimum value as well as a sum capacity across all cells. 
          Minimum value over time of this metric has more informational value than alerting value. 
          It can be an interesting heatmap, showing average variance and/or density over time. 
          Sum capacity can also be an interesting indicator of the need to potentially scale an environment. 
          However, the greater operational value is to understand a deployments average app size, 
          and monitor/alert on ensuring that at least some cells have large enough capacity to accept standard app size pushes. 
          For example, if pushing a 4&nbsp;GB app, Diego would have trouble placing that app if there is no one cell with sufficient capacity. 
          If deployment average was 3.9&nbsp;GB free, yet no one cell contained at least 4&nbsp;GB, the app push would fail. 
          As an example, Pivotal Cloud Ops uses a standard of 4&nbsp;GB, and computes and monitors 
          for the number of cells with at least 4&nbsp;GB free. 
          When the number of cells with at least 4&nbsp;GB falls below a defined threshold, 
          this is a scaling indicator alert to add additional capacity. 
          This "Free 4GB Chunk" count threshold should be tuned to the deployment size 
          and the standard size of apps being pushed to the platform.<br>

          Divide this metric by 1000 to get the value in GB.

Q: What is a "router negative case"?

Q: Is my rewrite of this okay? "
                    Regarding monitoring for router negative cases, the Router component team 
                    recommends that 'gorouter.total\_routes' is a better visualization metric to draw 
                    attention to a dramatic drop via dashboard monitoring, but the metric 
                    'gorouter.ms\_since\_last\_registry\_update' is a superior metric to generate triggered alerts from.:

Q: I changed "scale up or down the gorouter instances" to "scale up or down the router VMs" (We don't mention gorouter instances anywhere else — I assume that they are the same?)

Q: When is router used and when is Gorouter used? Are they the same or different? Can we standardize on this together? 

Q: Is there a simple way to say "route register management plane has failed"? e.g. "route registration has failed"?
