_Introductory text: Provide a sentence or two to introduce and describe this documentation. 
Make sure to use the full product name with trademarks the first time you mention the product in the text._

This documentation describes the [My Service for PCF]. [My Service] is a Pivotal Cloud Foundry service that provides a non-stop party for PCF components. Follow the procedures in this documentation to learn how to install, configure, use, and maintain [My Service].

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

_Whereas the introductory text above describes the documentation, this second-level section describes the service itself._
 
_Begin the overview with one or two short paragraphs describing what the service does and why it is useful. The goal is to give readers who are unfamiliar with the service enough information to decide if it is something they want or need to use._

Example, from [partner services documentation](http://docs.pivotal.io/appmon/index.html):
The Dynatrace Application Monitoring (AppMon) service enables in-depth monitoring of applications running on Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF). It uses an embedded agent bundled with applications that are deployed using Buildpacks. The service agent instruments the application by adding tracing and monitoring hooks to the code, then continuously sends the resulting data to AppMon account collectors. The AppMon account draws from this data to publish performance metrics and other details on the dashboards of the Dynatrace AppMon Client Application.

_If you need more than three or four paragraphs to explain and describe the service, put the additional information into an [About](about.html) page._

## <a id='new-features'></a>New Features (Optional)

_Short description or bullet points highlighting the most significant or interesting new features in the latest version of the product. This is just highlights—the full accounting of new stemcell compatibilities etc. belongs in the [Release Notes](./release-notes.html) topic._

The key new features in this release are:

* Feature 1 is the most amazing thing, for the first time ever.
* Feature 2 is even more amazing, and will revolutionize the enterprise.

## <a id='prerequisites'></a>Prerequisites

_Provide any general or specific requirements here. (Other documentation has called this 
Requirements, Includes, Dependencies, Client Dependencies, and Resources.) A general prerequisite might be something like, “An AppDynamics account.” A specific prerequisite might be something like, “Packaging Dependencies for Offline Buildpacks.”_

## <a id='known-issues'></a>Known Issues

_Under this second-level heading, list any known issues in this release._

_If there are many minor, known issues associated with this service that are not worthy of landing page space, you can add them to the release notes._

_If there are no known issues, say so. See Example 2 below._

_Example 1:_

* During a stemcell upgrade, there will be two ~2 min (time it takes your IaaS to create new VM) intervals where logs are not ingested. This happens when the singleton Queue and Router nodes are recreated. There is no workaround yet.
* ValueMetrics and CounterEvents consumed from the Firehose contain the incorrect @source information—specifically, the @source information is that of the consuming Firehose-to-Syslog VM from the PCF Log Search deployment rather than the information about the VM that generated the metric.
* Additional minor issues are listed in the Release Notes. 

_Example 2:_

There are no known issues for this release.
