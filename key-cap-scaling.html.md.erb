title: Key Capacity Scaling Indicators
owner: PCF Metrics Platform Monitoring
---

This topic describes key capacity scaling indicators that operators monitor to determine when
they need to scale their Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) deployments.

Pivotal provides these indicators to operators as general guidance for capacity scaling. 
Each indicator is based on platform metrics from different components. 
This guidance is applicable to most PCF v1.10 deployments.
Pivotal recommends that operators fine-tune the suggested alert thresholds 
by observing historical trends for their deployments. 

## <a id="doppler-server"></a> Doppler Server Scaling Indicator

Currently, there is only one key capacity scaling indicator recommended for the Doppler server.
It measures the fraction of messages dropped by the Doppler. 

### <a id="firehose-loss-rate"></a> Firehose Loss Rate

<table>
  <tr>
      <th colspan="2" style="text-align: center;">((DopplerServer.TruncatingBuffer.totalDroppedMessages + 
          DopplerServer.doppler.shedEnvelopes) / DopplerServer.listeners.totalReceivedMessageCount)</th>
  </tr>
   <tr>
      <th width="25">Description</th>
      <td>
       This derived metric is the fraction of messages intentionally dropped during the lifetime
       of the Doppler VM.
       </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <th>Purpose</th>
      <td>If there are too many dropped messages, the Dopplers may not be processing 
          messages fast enough. 
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <th>Recommended thresholds</th>
      <td><strong>Scale indicator</strong>: &ge; 0.1</br>
      If alerting:<br>
      <strong>Yellow warning</strong>: &ge; 0.05<br>
      <strong>Red critical</strong>: &ge; 0.1</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <th>How to scale up</th>
      <td>Consider scaling up Doppler/Loggregator instances. 
      </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <th>Additional Details</th>
      <td> <strong>Origin</strong>: Doppler/Firehose<br>
           <strong>Type</strong>: Gauge (float)<br>

      </td>
   </tr>
</table>

Q: When we talk about scaling, what do we mean by "Loggregator" instances? For doppler, we know we can increase the instance 
count in Ops Man.

## <a id="bosh"></a> System (BOSH) Scaling Indicators

Currently, there are three key capacity scaling indicators recommended for the the BOSH system:

+ [Router VM CPU Utilization](#system.cpu.user) is a measure of Gorouter performance
+ [Diego Cell Compute Capacity](#derivedsystemload)

### <a id="system.cpu.user"></a> Gorouter Latency and Throughput

(Q: WHAT exactly is "System (BOSH)"? This term is not used anywhere else in the PCF doc set.)

###<a id="system.cpu.user"></a>Router VM CPU Utilization

<table>
  <tr>
      <th colspan="2" style="text-align: center;">system.cpu.user</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <th>Description</th>
      <td>CPU usage of the Gorouter VM</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <th>Purpose</th>
      <td>High CPU usage in the router VMs can increase latency and cause throughput, or requests per second, to level off.
          In performance and load testing, Pivotal has observed on its Pivotal Web Services deployment that an inflection
          point for decreasing performance is approximately 60% CPU utilization. 
          </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <th>Recommended thresholds</th>
      <td><strong>Scale indicator</strong>: &ge; 60%<br>
      If alerting:<br>
      <strong>Yellow warning</strong>: &ge; 60%<br>
      <strong>Red critical</strong>: &ge; 70%<br>
      </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <th>How to scale up</th>
      <td>If the maximum CPU utilization is over 70%, scale the Gorouters horizontally or vertically.
      </td>
